Modeling the Training Iteration Time for Heterogeneous Distributed Deep Learning Systems in PS+BSP

We use [tensorflow-benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks) to measure the iteration training time, and the corresponding code is available in the benchmark folder.

The experimental data are saved in the file "experimental-data.xlsx", where the worksheets "alexnet" and "vgg" are the calculation time of the correspond DNN model. The rest of the tables correspond to the results of each experiment in the paper, respectively.

The source code  to predict the computational effort will be available in the next commit.
